This is a very simple fork allowing Poppin' to use existing clients without keeping track of them internally. Pop an existing client like so:
```lua
local f = poppin.popClient(client, [position[, size[, properties]]])
```

This function does not take the `callback` parameter of `poppin.pop`, because if you already have the client, you can just call anything you want on it. 

After using `poppin.popClient`, you can call it again or use the returned zero-argument function to toggle the client's visibility.

# Poppin'
Poppin' is a module for awesome wm which allows the user to toggle a client. You could for example have a client which appears on a keyboard shortcut and toggles when the shortcut is pressed again. Poppin' clients are persistent between awesome restarts.

## Download
```sh
git clone https://github.com/raksooo/poppin.git ~/.config/awesome/poppin
```

## Usage
In your rc.lua:
```lua
local poppin = require('poppin')
```

### poppin.pop()
```lua
poppin.pop(name, command, [position[, size[, properties[, callback]]]])
```

Where name is a name associated with the client. Command is the shell-command used to start the program. Position can be either "top", "bottom", "left", "right" or "center". The size is the width or height (depending on position) in pixels.

poppin.pop(...) toggles the client if used multiple times, and returns a toggling function which doesn't require any arguments.

### poppin.isPoppin()
To check if a client is handled by poppin, poppin.isPoppin() can be used.
```lua
poppin.isPoppin(client)
```
poppin.isPoppin() returns either true or false.

### Examples
Creating a poppin client:
```lua
poppin.pop("terminal", "urxvt", "top")
poppin.pop("terminal", "urxvt", "center", { width = 1000, height = 300 })
poppin.pop("terminal", "urxvt", "top", function (c) c.minimized = true end)
poppin.pop("messenger", "messengerfordesktop", "right")
```

Toggling a poppin window by calling the pop function using the same name:
```lua
awful.key({ super }, "x", function () poppin.pop("messenger", "messengerfordesktop", "right", 1000) end,
          {description = "Opens a poppin' messenger window", group = "poppin"}),

awful.key({ super }, "z", function () poppin.pop("terminal", "urxvt", "center", 1000) end,
          {description = "Opens a poppin' terminal", group = "poppin"}),
```

Toggling a poppin window using returned function:
```lua
local poppin_terminal = poppin.pop("terminal", "urxvt", "top", 1000, { border_width = 5 })

awful.key({ super }, "x", poppin_terminal,
          {description = "Opens a poppin' messenger window", group = "poppin"}),
```

Check if a client is a poppin client:
```lua
poppin.pop("terminal", "urxvt", function (c)
    poppin.isPoppin(c) -- returns true
end)
```
